        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h2>Basic Strucure of a HTML document</h2>
        <p>
          When writing a document be it a friendly letter, an official one or even a research proposal you need to follow a certain format which will make it clear that this is a particular type of letter. The same approach is followed when writing HTML code to make the browser aware that this is a HTML document.
        </p>
        <h3>The Declaration</h3>
        <p>
          Every HTML document must begin with the <strong>!DOCTYPE</strong> declaration. What this tells the browser is that <em>"hey this is a particular version of HTML"</em> and for out case it'll  be <em>HTML5</em>
        </p>
        <h3>The HTML Root Element</h3>
        <p>
          Just like every book has covers inside of which are pages, HTML documents too have these <em>covers</em> which encloses everything within the document
        </p>
        <p>
          In HTML, these <em>covers</em> are represented by the <strong>html</strong> element.
        </p>
        <h3>The Head Element</h3>
        <p>
          When you buy a product say a new TV, inside the packaging always comes some instruction manual on how to set up the TV and other additional information like the manufacturer, the dos and donts and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we write HTML, we are always writing the code so that our browser can actually interpret and render the document on your screen. Inside the <strong>head</strong> element is where we can always provide the browser with certain additional information and instructions on how to display the page.
        </p>
        <h3>The Body Element</h3>
        <p>
           Taking a formal letter as an example, after writing your address, the recipient's address and the your letter's reference, you then begin to write the main content of your letter. In HTML, the main content of your document is wrapped inside the <strong>body</strong> element and this is what the browser will interpret and display on your screen
        </p>
